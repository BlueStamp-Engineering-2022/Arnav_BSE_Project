# Third Milestone
My third milestone is also my final milestone. In my last milestone, I controlled the robot arm through an app on the android phone. But this time, I will be controlling it through an app that I made from the MIT App Inventor where I built the code. I also used the Arduino app to help connect the bluetooth to the machine. I later uploaded the code to onto the phone and controlled the machine using that app.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the phone controlled robot arm. In the last video I controlled the robot arm with the controller that is attached to the machine, but this time I am controlling the machine with the phone. I had to first download the app from online because it cannot be found on the phone. After I finished downloading the app, I had to uppload a code from the arduino app to the app on the phone which will alow me to control the robot arm with the phone.

# First Milestone
My first milesonte is the phone controlled robot arm which can move and pick up things. This machine can be controlled through a controller that is attached to it and can also be controlled by a phone. I attached three servos on the arm. One servo allows the arm move front and back. Another servo allows the arm to spin around. The other servo allows the arm to move up and down. The three servos are connected to the circut board which is connected to my computer which I programmed from the arduino app to to control the robot arm to move.

# Starter Project
The TV-B-Gone is a machine that allows you turn of any TV within 150 ft or more. The machine has over 230 codes in the microchip which is the brain of the machine and will power the entire thing. I thought of choosing this project because I wanted to see if this machine can actually turn of a TV without using a remote.
