# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milesonte in the phone controlled robot arm which can move and pick up things. This machine can be controlled through a controller that is attached to it and can also be controlled by a phone. I attached three servos on the arm. One servo allows the arm move front and back. Another servo allows the arm to spin around. The other servo allows the arm to move up and down. The three servos are connected to the circut board which is connected to my computer which I programmed the arduino to to control the robot arm to move.

# Starter Project
The TV-B-Gone is a machine that allows you turn of any TV within 150 ft or more. The machine has over 230 codes in the microchip which is the brain of the machine and will power the entire thing. I thought of choosing this project because I wanted to see if this machine can actually turn of a TV without using a remote.
