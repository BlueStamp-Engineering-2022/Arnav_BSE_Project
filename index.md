# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Starter Project
The TV-B-Gone is a machine that allows you turn of any TV within 150 ft or more. The machine has over 230 codes in the microchip which is the brain of the machine and will power the entire thing. I thought of choosing this project because I wanted to see if this machine can actually turn of a TV without using a remote.
